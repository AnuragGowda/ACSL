# ACSL
Basically a repo for my acsl solutions for the problems that I did so far. 
For each year there are folders for each contest that have the problem as a pdf along with my solution (python).
All of the solutions (so far?) are "one-liners" as they only take up one line, also my thought process of how I got to the onliner is commented.
